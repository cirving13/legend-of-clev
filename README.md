This is my lovely game :) 

I used about every single tutorial on the internet, except the ones that built the entire map together like I should have

Some known issues:
	most of the time, some game objects are invisible. They spawn, and you can make contact with them, however you cant see them. It is possible for the player, both enemies, both drops, as well as the End goal tile

	When the player dies, the game is still searching for the Transform of player for the enemy AI, but the player is dead. Therefore making a ton of errors until you load the main menu or quit. 

	The text is hard coded, not going to fit individual resolutions...sorry

	The player spawns in the middle of the room, each time, unsure how to make them spawn next to the door they came from

	if you walk back into a room you already killed the enemies in and looted, it will reset the room exactly as before. not sure if an issue, but it happens

If you have any other questions/complaints about it, I am available with my email: cirving@chapman.edu and phone number: 949-231-0171
